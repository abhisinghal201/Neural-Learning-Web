**⏱️ Duration:** 15 minutes hands-on + 10 minutes reflection

**🔧 Setup:**
```python
from visualization import bayesian_updating_simulator

2. **Spam Detection Learning**
   - **Prior:** Start with 50% spam probability (neutral belief)
   - **Evidence:** Email contains words "urgent", "free", "click here"
   - **Updating:** Watch posterior probability increase with each suspicious word
   - **Reverse:** Add legitimate words like "meeting", "report" and see probability decrease
   - **ML Connection:** This is exactly how naive Bayes spam filters learn

3. **Coin Fairness Assessment**
   - **Prior:** Start with uniform belief about coin bias (p = 0.5 ± uncertainty)
   - **Evidence:** Observe sequence of heads and tails
   - **Sequential Updating:** See how each flip updates your belief
   - **Convergence:** Watch belief converge to true bias with enough data

   - **Prior:** Start with weak beliefs about which is better
   - **Evidence:** Sequential user interactions (convert or not)
   - **Decision Making:** At what point are you confident one design is better?
   - **Business Reality:** This mirrors real-time A/B testing platforms

5. **Prior Sensitivity Analysis**
   - **Strong vs Weak Priors:** Compare confident vs uncertain starting beliefs
   - **Evidence Requirements:** How much data needed to overcome strong priors?
   - **Prior Choice Impact:** When do priors matter vs when does data dominate?
   - **Philosophical Insight:** How do our preconceptions affect learning?

   - **Minimum Detectable Effect:** 0.5% improvement (to 3.7%)
   - **Statistical Power:** 80% chance of detecting true effect
   - **Required Sample:** ~8,500 users per group
   - **Business Constraint:** Test duration and traffic allocation

3. **Data Collection**

   - **Monthly Lift:** $250,000 increase (15.6% improvement)
   - **Annual Impact:** $3M additional revenue from 0.5% conversion improvement

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - **Type I Error:** False positive - implement bad design (5% risk)
   - **Type II Error:** False negative - miss good design (20% risk)
   - **Implementation Cost:** Development time, user experience risk
   - **Opportunity Cost:** Delay in finding better solutions

3. **Statistical vs Practical Significance**
   - **Statistical Significance:** P-value < 0.05 (evidence of difference)
   - **Practical Significance:** Effect size large enough to justify implementation
   - **Minimum Viable Effect:** What improvement justifies development cost?
   - **Business Decision:** Combine statistical evidence with business judgment

**🔬 Advanced Considerations:**

1. **Multiple Testing Problem**
   - **Issue:** Testing many variations increases false positive rate
   - **Solution:** Bonferroni correction or False Discovery Rate control

   - **Method:** Subgroup analysis with interaction testing
   - **Caution:** Avoid HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known)

**📊 Example Results:**
```python
A/B Test Results:
Control Group: 8,547 users, 274 conversions (3.21%)
Treatment Group: 8,623 users, 318 conversions (3.69%)

Statistical Analysis:
Difference: +0.48 percentage points
